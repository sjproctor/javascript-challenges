// Write an if/else statement that takes a variable of a boolean, number, or string datatype and logs the data type of the variable HINT: use the JS operator typeof.

// Epic Challenge
// Create a password checker using a single if/else statement. If a user inputs a password with 12 or more characters AND the password includes !, then log "That is a mighty strong password". If the userâ€™s password is equal to 8 or more characters OR includes !, then log "that password is strong enough!". Log "password is not strong enough" for every other input.
let myPassword = "abcde"
